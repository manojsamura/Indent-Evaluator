						INDENT CHECKER

########################################################################################################

This module is a part of the automated programming assignment assessment module.
This module checks the formating of the program and evaluates the code based on the structure of
the code.

To run the module use the following command:
	python run_module.py <filename>

You can have multiple filenames as arguments.

The evaluation is done by the module after certain code cleaning like removing the comments,
quotation, extra lines etc.

This evaluation is based on eucildean distance of the ideal code and the code given to the system.

The codes is evaluateed for the different blocks in the code.
Each block is checked and evaluated based on the criteria mentioned above, and the final value is
aggregated over all blocks.

The module provides two output files.

The first output of the code is in the ic_<filename> file.
-> This file will have the evaluation details of the code stating the grades of the code.

The second output of the code is in the <filename>_indent_feedback.
-> This file will have the output of the evaluated code, which can be used by the students to verify
the errors in their code so that they can improve the next time.


This module can be used to check the indentation of the languages like c,c++,java etc.

There is an example folder which has some files which can be used to check the module and help in 
exploring about the module.
